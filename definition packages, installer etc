####### CONDA #######
## is a package and an enviroment manager [provided by anaconda or miniconda]

       # Handles non‑Python dependencies (e.g., R, gcc, BLAS, libpng).
       # Creates isolated environments (conda create -n myenv)

## basic functions in CONDA, to be expleted in powershell
  # conda "create -n" + "python=version" # to create a new environment within python
  # conda "activate" # to activate the environment you created with the last command
  # conda "install -c channel" followed by packages # to install a package
      ### use defaults for basic packages, conda-forge for new or rare packages, bioconda for bioinformatic packages
  # keep in mind that channels arerepository (sources) where conda looks for packages
